You will build a very modern stock tracker.
The tracker will be mainly dark themed, will have degrade shades of greens and reds.
The design will be minimalistic, so data and charts are at the core of actions.
To start I need one screen where users can see a table with the list of their holdings.
When clicking a add button on the top right, the user will see a dialog with a list of stocks he can choose from, the date, amount of stocks bought and price.
Once the stock is added the dialog closes and we see the new stock on the Portfolio table/list.
Each row of the table will have the name and ticker of stock a small chart, a valuation metric and some alerts.
If the user clicks a stock he can see a preview on the right panel on the side of the list.
We will mainly be focusing on earnings transaripts analysis. The side panel will have bullet points with the most importans subjects of the earnins transcripts.
We will leverage supabase to store user data and portfolio data. Each user can have multiple portfolios.
The design should be inspire by the image attached.

You did well, but there are a couple of points we need to improve.
The sign-up screen has text that is not readable inside the inputs. You need to use white colors for text and foreground on a dark theme. You probably need to adjust the shadcn theme.
Also we need a more modern font. I don't like when we use too much bold. And big texts.
Finally everything is looking a bit big.
I will add another image for inspiration here so you can match my design taste better.
We need more dégradés and glows to make it look modern

Lets explore different greens and reds tones, which are more modern and with minimalistic glows.
